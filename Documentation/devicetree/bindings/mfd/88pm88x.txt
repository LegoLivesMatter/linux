Marvell 88pm88x combo PMIC chip

This series of chip integrates regulator, rtc, onkey, switch charger,
fuelgauge, gpadc and a range of I/O pins.

88pm886 and 88pm880 are two very similar chips, most of the registers mapping
and functions are the same, the main difference is the latter has a separate
i2c slave address to cover BUCK related setting

Required properties:
- compatible: one of the strings for a specific chip:
  "marvell,88pm886"
  "marvell,88pm880"
- reg: the i2c address
- interrupt-controller: it works as an interrupt controller managing its irqs
- interrupt-cells: this value is 1

Optional properties:
- marvell,88pm88x-irq-write-clear: the interrupt ack method


Example:

	pmic: 88pm886@30 {
		compatible = "marvell,88pm886";
		reg = <0x30>;
		interrupts = <0 4 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;

		marvell,88pm88x-irq-write-clear;
	};
